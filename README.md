## 3. Frontend Architecture Deep Dive

### 3.1 Angular Application Structure

The frontend implements Angular best practices with a modular architecture supporting maintainability and scalability. The application structure follows Angular's recommended patterns with clear separation between feature modules, shared components, and core services.

### 3.2 Core Components and Modules

**Authentication Components** located in `/src/app/components/auth/` provide comprehensive user authentication functionality:

The `LoginComponent` handles user authentication with form validation and error handling. The `RegistrationComponent` manages new user registration with client-side validation before backend submission. The `ChangePasswordComponent` provides secure password management with confirmation validation.

**Shopping Components** in `/src/app/components/ProductsPage/` deliver the core e-commerce experience:

The `ProductsComponent` serves as the main product listing interface with pagination and filtering capabilities. The `ProductDetailsComponent` provides detailed product information with purchase options. The `ProductCardComponent` offers reusable product display functionality across different contexts. The `ProductsFilterComponent` enables category-based filtering with real-time updates. The `CartComponent` manages shopping cart operations with real-time calculation updates. The `CheckoutComponent` handles the order processing workflow.

**Admin Components** in `/src/app/components/admin/` provide administrative functionality:

The `ManageProductsComponent` delivers comprehensive product CRUD operations with form validation and image handling. The `ManageUsersComponent` provides user management interfaces with role assignment capabilities.

**Common Components** ensure consistent user experience:

The `HeaderComponent` maintains application branding and navigation. The `NavBarComponent` provides responsive navigation with authentication-aware menu options. The `FooterComponent` displays application information and links. The `ProfileComponent` enables user profile management with secure update functionality.

### 3.3 Services and State Management

The Angular application implements service-based architecture for data management and business logic:

**AuthService** manages user authentication and authorization with JWT token handling, automatic token refresh, and role-based access control. The service maintains authentication state across application sessions and provides methods for login, logout, and profile management.

**ProductService** handles all product-related operations including product retrieval, filtering, and search functionality. The service implements caching strategies for improved performance and manages product state across components.

**CartService** provides comprehensive shopping cart functionality with real-time updates, persistent storage, and calculation services. The service maintains cart state across user sessions and synchronizes with backend services.

**UserService** manages user data operations including profile updates, password changes, and user management functions for administrative users.

**JwtService** handles JWT token management with automatic renewal, secure storage, and token validation. The service ensures secure communication with backend APIs.

**ThemeService** manages application theming with light and dark mode support, user preference persistence, and dynamic theme switching.

### 3.4 Routing and Navigation

The Angular application implements comprehensive routing with protection mechanisms:

**Main Routes** provide clear navigation structure:

- Root path `/` directs to the home page with featured products and promotional content
- `/products` displays the main product listing with filtering and pagination
- `/products/:id` shows detailed product information with purchase options
- `/cart` provides shopping cart management and checkout initiation
- `/checkout` handles the complete checkout process

### 8.2 DTO Specifications

**AppUserDTO Structure** provides comprehensive user data transfer:

```java
public class AppUserDTO {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private List<String> roles;
    private LocalDateTime createdAt;
}
```

This structure corresponds directly to the frontend `IAppUser` interface ensuring consistent data handling across the application stack.

**ProductDTO Structure** enables complete product information transfer:

```java
public class ProductDTO {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private BigDecimal price;
    private String imageUrl;
    private String categoryName;
    private Integer stockQuantity;
    private Boolean available;
}
```

The ProductDTO aligns with frontend `IProduct` interface supporting all product display and management functionality.

**CartDTO Structure** facilitates comprehensive cart management:

```java
public class CartDTO {
    private String id;
    private String appUserId;
    private List<CartItemDTO> items;
    private BigDecimal totalPrice;
    private Integer itemCount;
    private LocalDateTime lastUpdated;
}
```

This structure supports the frontend `ICart` interface enabling real-time cart synchronization and management.

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        return http
            .csrf(csrf -> csrf.disable())
            .sessionManagement(session -> session.sessionCreationPolicy(STATELESS))
            .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                .requestMatchers("/auth/**", "/appUser/addAppUser").permitAll()
                .requestMatchers("/product/**", "/category/**").permitAll()
                .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, "/appUser/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/product/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .oauth2ResourceServer(oauth2 -> oauth2.jwt(Customizer.withDefaults()))
            .build();
    }
}
```

This configuration aligns with frontend route protection ensuring consistent security enforcement across the application.
