\section{Frontend Architecture}

\subsection{Angular Application Structure}

The frontend implements Angular best practices with a modular architecture supporting maintainability and scalability. The application structure follows Angular's recommended patterns with clear separation between feature modules, shared components, and core services.

\subsection{Core Components and Modules}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authentication Components} located in \texttt{/src/app/components/auth/} provide comprehensive user authentication functionality:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item The \texttt{LoginComponent} handles user authentication with form validation and error handling. The \texttt{RegistrationComponent} manages new user registration with client-side validation before backend submission. The \texttt{ChangePasswordComponent} provides secure password management with confirmation validation.
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Shopping Components} in \texttt{/src/app/components/ProductsPage/} deliver the core e-commerce experience:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item The \texttt{ProductsComponent} serves as the main product listing interface with pagination and filtering capabilities. The \texttt{ProductDetailsComponent} provides detailed product information with purchase options. The \texttt{ProductCardComponent} offers reusable product display functionality across different contexts. The \texttt{ProductsFilterComponent} enables category-based filtering with real-time updates. The \texttt{CartComponent} manages shopping cart operations with real-time calculation updates. The \texttt{CheckoutComponent} handles the order processing workflow.
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Admin Components} in \texttt{/src/app/components/admin/} provide administrative functionality:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item The \texttt{ManageProductsComponent} delivers comprehensive product CRUD operations with form validation and image handling. The \texttt{ManageUsersComponent} provides user management interfaces with role assignment capabilities.
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Common Components} ensure consistent user experience:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item The \texttt{HeaderComponent} maintains application branding and navigation. The \texttt{NavBarComponent} provides responsive navigation with authentication-aware menu options. The \texttt{FooterComponent} displays application information and links. The \texttt{ProfileComponent} enables user profile management with secure update functionality.
          \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Services and State Management}

The Angular application implements service-based architecture for data management and business logic:

\textbf{AuthService} manages user authentication and authorization with JWT token handling, automatic token refresh, and role-based access control. The service maintains authentication state across application sessions and provides methods for login, logout, and profile management.

\textbf{ProductService} handles all product-related operations including product retrieval, filtering, and search functionality. The service implements caching strategies for improved performance and manages product state across components.

\textbf{CartService} provides comprehensive shopping cart functionality with real-time updates, persistent storage, and calculation services. The service maintains cart state across user sessions and synchronizes with backend services.

\textbf{UserService} manages user data operations including profile updates, password changes, and user management functions for administrative users.

\textbf{JwtService} handles JWT token management with automatic renewal, secure storage, and token validation. The service ensures secure communication with backend APIs.

\textbf{ThemeService} manages application theming with light and dark mode support, user preference persistence, and dynamic theme switching.

\subsection{Routing and Navigation}

The Angular application implements comprehensive routing with protection mechanisms:

\textbf{Main Routes} provide clear navigation structure:

\subsection{DTO Architecture Integration}

The application maintains consistent data transfer between frontend and backend through comprehensive DTO implementation ensuring type safety and data integrity across the application stack.

\subsection{DTO Specifications}

\textbf{AppUserDTO Structure} provides comprehensive user data transfer:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,caption=AppUserDTO Structure]
public class AppUserDTO {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private List<String> roles;
    private LocalDateTime createdAt;
}
\end{lstlisting}

This structure corresponds directly to the frontend \texttt{IAppUser} interface ensuring consistent data handling across the application stack.

\textbf{ProductDTO Structure} enables complete product information transfer:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,caption=ProductDTO Structure]
public class ProductDTO {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private BigDecimal price;
    private String imageUrl;
    private String categoryName;
    private Integer stockQuantity;
    private Boolean available;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The ProductDTO aligns with frontend \texttt{IProduct} interface supporting all product display and management functionality.

\textbf{CartDTO Structure} facilitates comprehensive cart management:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,caption=CartDTO Structure]
public class CartDTO {
    private String id;
    private String appUserId;
    private List<CartItemDTO> items;
    private BigDecimal totalPrice;
    private Integer itemCount;
    private LocalDateTime lastUpdated;
}
\end{lstlisting}

This structure supports the frontend \texttt{ICart} interface enabling real-time cart synchronization and management.

\section{Configuration Management}

\subsection{Backend Application Configuration}

The Spring Boot backend implements comprehensive configuration management:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=properties,caption=Backend Application Configuration]
# Application Identity
spring.application.name=Application

# Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/web_project_db?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
spring.datasource.username=${DB_USERNAME:root}
spring.datasource.password=${DB_PASSWORD:}
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

# JPA Configuration
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=${SHOW_SQL:false}
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

# Security Configuration
jwt.secret=${JWT_SECRET:mySecretKey}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Frontend Environment Configuration}

The Angular application implements environment-specific configuration:

\textbf{Environment Files} provide development and production settings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{environment.ts} contains development configuration with API URL\\ set to \texttt{http://localhost:8080} and development-specific feature flags
    \item Production environment configuration supports deployment-specific settings and optimizations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Configuration Integration}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,caption=Security Configuration]
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        return http
            .csrf(csrf -> csrf.disable())
            .sessionManagement(session -> session.sessionCreationPolicy(STATELESS))
            .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                .requestMatchers("/auth/**", "/appUser/addAppUser").permitAll()
                .requestMatchers("/product/**", "/category/**").permitAll()
                .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, "/appUser/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/product/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .oauth2ResourceServer(oauth2 -> oauth2.jwt(Customizer.withDefaults()))
            .build();
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

This configuration aligns with frontend route protection ensuring consistent security enforcement across the application.
